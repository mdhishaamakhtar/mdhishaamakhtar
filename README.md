# 👋 Hey, I’m Hishaam

> I care deeply about how things work — but even more about who they help.

I’m a backend engineer who loves building thoughtful systems, expressive tools, and things that quietly make a difference. Currently, I’m part of the Engineering team at **Groww**, where I’ve worked on scaling data infrastructure, powering real-time engagement, and designing systems that serve millions.

Outside of work, I explore the intersection of **technology, human behavior, and social good** — particularly how AI might support **addiction recovery**, **mental health**, and **education equity**.  

🛠️ You’ll find me working on:
- 🧠 Real-time platforms (Kafka, WebSockets, Pinot)
- 📊 Data pipelines & infra (Spark, Trino, GCP)
- 💡 Creative hackathon projects with social impact
- 🌈 Queer-inclusive tech advocacy
